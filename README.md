Amazon Bestselling Books Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

# Introduction
As a gargantuan company, Amazon provides a wide selection of books for its customers. Books are never judged by its cover, but everyone should also be able to rate books (not just journalists or editors). Amazon enables customers to rate books by giving them scores between 1-5 and a detailed review text to help others decide whether to purchase a particular book or not.

In this notebook, we will attempt to explore the dataset consisting of books that are on the list of Amazon's best selling book between 2009 and 2019. We will analyze the authors, the genres and lastly, the most worthy book for purchase.
